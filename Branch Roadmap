This is a list of what I want to accomplish with this branch before merging it.
It also includes the order these things will get done. 

Goals:
  Basic, testable, functionality in the three different sections of the project. 
    Java Core: Read and Write character data to the database and store token data and map tile data from a default map. 
    Database Backend: A single database holding saved character data accessible to anyone. (Login system will be later.)
    Web Frontend: A simple interface to test reading and writing to the database with asynchronous updating. 
                  Also viewing and changing token and tile data. 
                  
Order:
  1. Java
  2. Database
  3. Web
